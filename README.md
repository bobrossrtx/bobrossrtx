# Hey, I'm Owen 👋

I’m a self‑taught programmer with ~5 years of experience and a T‑Level IT student from the UK.  
I split my time between **low‑level systems programming** (kernels, VMs, custom languages) and **full‑stack web development**.

I enjoy:
- Building things from the ground up (kernels, VMs, custom interpreters/compilers)
- Designing **clean architectures** with a focus on **clarity, documentation, and testing**
- Experimenting with **languages, runtimes, and tooling** to understand how things really work under the hood

---

## 🔭 What I’m Looking For

- ✅ **Open source projects to contribute to**  
- ✅ **Contributors for [Demi](https://github.com/bobrossrtx/demi)** – my experimental programming language  
- ✅ **Open to freelance work** (especially systems, backend, or full‑stack projects)

## 🧠 Tech Stack

### 🏗️ Systems & Low‑Level

- **Languages:** `C` · `C++` · `Rust`
- **Domains:** kernels, custom VMs, language runtimes, low‑level tooling
- **Tools & Workflows:** `GNU Make` · `GCC/Clang` · `GDB` · `Linux` · virtual machines

Used heavily in:

- [TinyKernel](https://github.com/TinyKern/TinyKernel) – experimental kernel work  
- [Demi](https://github.com/bobrossrtx/demi) – custom compiled & VM‑interpreted language

---

### 🌐 Web & Full‑Stack

- **Frontend:** `React` · `TypeScript/JavaScript` · `Tailwind CSS`
- **Backend:** `Rust` · `Rocket` (APIs & backend services)
- **Databases:** `MongoDB` (primary) · `MySQL` (for local/file‑based setups)
- **Environments & Tooling:** `Linux` · `Windows` · `GitHub Codespaces` · `Git`

I’ve built multiple **data‑driven web apps** that manage and visualize information, with a focus on reliability and maintainability.

---

### 🧪 How I Like to Build

- **Clean architecture first** – structure before features  
- **Well‑documented code & projects** – future‑me (and others) should understand the why  
- **Unit testing as a must** – to validate functionality and stability, especially in low‑level or language/runtime work  
- Curious, experimental, and always willing to refactor for a better design

## 🚀 Featured Project: Demi

### [Demi](https://github.com/bobrossrtx/demi)

> An experimental programming language aiming to become a **commercial‑grade language** with its own **ISA, VM, and compilation pipeline**.

**What it is:**

- A **compiled & virtualised_interpreter** language  
- Uses its own **ISA**: `dasm` (Demi Assembly)  
- `dasm` **transpiles to native machine code**  
- The higher‑level language, **Demi**, is designed to be:
  - Powerful but **customizable to the user**
  - Compiling down to `dasm`, which then targets native code via a **custom VM interpreter**

**Tech & Tools:**

- `C++17`
- `GNU Make`
- `Linux` & `Windows`
- Developed extensively in **GitHub Codespaces**

**Why it matters (to me):**

- It’s a deep dive into:
  - Language design
  - Virtual machine and ISA design
  - Compilation pipelines
- It ties together my interests in:
  - Low‑level systems
  - Tooling
  - Clean, testable architecture

## 🧬 Other Notable Work

### [TinyKernel](https://github.com/TinyKern/TinyKernel)

A **small experimental kernel** project exploring:

- Low‑level bootflows
- Memory and hardware interaction
- OS‑level architecture from scratch

This project reflects my interest in **understanding the full stack from hardware to high‑level code**.
